        <div class="rect">We can't deny that technologies are introduced to our lives day in day out and its growth changes the system
            of education gardually and getting knowlage becomes easier. In most countries teachers still work with children,
            explaining inf on a desk but possibly there will come a time when robots substitute them or at least change their role
            and perhaps students will be more interested in studing.</div>
        <div class="rect">Due to the need to give education more individual approach, the priority will be given to homeschooling. Students 
            will be able to study and learn what they want, when they want, and for as long as they want. It will also give more 
            physical and emotional freedom as well as opportunity to spend more time with family.</div>
        <div class="rect">Games that help kids code, toys which teach robotics, and various apps for teachers to efficiently deliver information
            to students will become common. Technologies will facilitate teaching and learning process. Learning will come to be 
            more creative and practical. </div>
        <div class="rect">The role of a teacher will be not only to pass the knowledge but also to identify student’s strengths, interests and 
            values. Teachers will perform as facilitators to support students in developing their way of thinking and learning
